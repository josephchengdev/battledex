# Battledex

### Overview
This project was part of a short hackathon, and is essentially the front-end for a competitive Pokémon battling database website. It was built using Angular and makes calls to PokéAPI for data.

### Build And Test the Website Yourself
If you want to build and test how the code works, you can fork the repo and pull it to your own computer. From there, you can open the folder with terminal and perform the following to get started:

`sudo npm install` - Installs all the required dependencies to get the website up and running

`ng serve`- Builds and serves the app -> See it using any web browser at  http://localhost:4200/
